    Scratch: it's not Perl, nor has much of anything to do with Perl. But it
    is kinda neat and fun to play with. You see, have a look here: http://scratch.mit.edu/
    It's a programming language for kids. With no syntax. Or, rather, the syntax is 
    disguised as the shape of blocks that fit together to make programs. Er, "scripts".

    Here's a scratch project that my partner and I made while on an airplane ride. 
    http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/helvella/2001223
    (If you create an account & login, then you get access to the beta flash player,
    which is much better at playing these scratch projets in the browser than the 
    default java applet.)

    Turned out to be pretty fun to pass the laptop back and forth, taking turns 
    dorking with the sratch. Kind of like those stories you wrote in junior high, 
    where you passed pieces of paper around the room, and each person in turn added
    another sentence. 

    Anyhow, let's do that, yeah. Pre-install scratch on your laptop, bring it to the
    bar. Then we'll make some projects, pass the puters around to take turns dorkin
    'em all up. Sounds fun.
