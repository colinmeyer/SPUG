    David Ihnen has over ten years experience with progressively more
    object-oriented Perl programming. He learned DBIx::Class for the interview
    questions for a job in Flagstaff, Arizona at a urine analysis lab where he
    helped build a web-based lab result management system for use by their
    clients. Now he is back in Seattle at Amazon (for the third time), where
    he builds test frameworks and untangles the vagaries of complex financial
    perl scripts. He currently lives in Issaquah with his 15-year partner,
    Dhugal, and two german shepherd dogs, Akando and Banshee.
