    Acmeism (http://acmeism.org) is the ability to think about and express
    one's creative ideas, beyond language borders. In programming, this means
    creating things that benefit multiple languages and communities. Perl is
    effectively one great community with 2 great languages (Perl 5 and Perl 6).
    Acmeism is essential to mongers, but kindly extends to pythonistas, brigadiers
    and nodelings as well.

    Pegex is an Acmeist parsing language. Think of it as Perl 6 Rules and
    Regexp::Grammars for all programmers. Write One Grammar, Parse Everywhere. This
    makes Pegex the quintessential tool in the Acmeist's belt. Pegex.pm is fully
    functional in Perl 5, and working it's way across the Acmeist landscape.
