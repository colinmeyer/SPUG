title: Getting Comfortable with the Perl Precedence Table
speaker: Tye McQueen

talk_blurb: |
    Getting Comfortable with the Perl Precedence Table: Help in
    understanding it, not memorizing it, and making good use of it. The
    good, the bad, and the ugly of it. And some "best practices"
    suggestions.

    Tye says, of his involvement with Perl, "I have been programming Perl
    since the last days of Perl 3 but have only recently moved to Seattle to
    enjoy my first ever paid position as a "Perl Programmer". I have made
    several small contributions to the Perl source code but am most visible
    in the Perl community of late as one of the absentee landlords of
    http://PerlMonks.org/ and as the author and/or absentee landlord of
    several modules including Win32::TieRegistry, Algorithm::Loops,
    Algorithm:Diff, Acme::ESP, and Devel::EvalError. With regard to the
    topic of my talk, I am proud to note that I recently convinced Larry
    Wall to add one more slot to the Perl 6 precedence table (but my talk is
    about the Perl 5 precedence table)."
