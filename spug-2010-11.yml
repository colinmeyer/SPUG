    I am a Perl software developer and a technical writer and Linux
    enthusiast. I have over a decade of computer industry experience in
    roles that include Web Development, IT Support, System Administration,
    Release Engineering, and Technical Communications. I'm a co-organizer
    for the Seattle LinuxChix chapter and a regular attendee at a plethora
    of other Open Source user groups. In my spare time I knit and tinker
    with Arduino.
