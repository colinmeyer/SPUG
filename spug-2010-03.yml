    Tim's going to talk about Perl. Aside from that, he'll talk about whatever he
    wants to talk about. Why? Well, lots of reasons! But he did mention, "What I'd
    most like to do is show some of the less commonly seen programming examples
    from my book[1], and tell the more "edgy" versions of the stories that my
    publisher made me tone down for political correctness (e.g., the non-sanitized
    version of "The Legend of Nexpr").

    Dr. Maher has trekked a remarkable path through life. A few examples
    include singing (twice) with The Persuasions (a cappella), playing and
    studying the sitar with Nazir Jairazbhoy in India, writing a top-selling
    book, teaching as a professor of psychology, and writing and performing
    "Christmas Break by Rapmaster Scrooge[2]"
