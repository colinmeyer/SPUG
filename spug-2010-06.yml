title: C'Dent, the Acmeism, and Everyone
speaker: Ingy dot Net

talk_blurb: |
 Ingy will give a talk about:
 
  * Acmeism[1] - Programming above programming languages
  * C'Dent[2] - A portable module programming language
  * Stardoc[3] - An Acmeist documentation system
  * TestML[4] - An Acmeist unit test language

 Imagine writing a Perl module, and then uploading it to RubyGems and PyPi and
 a dozen other language repositories as a native module for that language.
 C'Dent compiles modules Perl, Python, Ruby and JavaScript modules to many
 languages. Stardoc reformats POD to many other formats. TestML lets you write
 one set of tests that all the compiled modules must pass before shipping.
 
 This is the future. This is Acmeism.

 Ingy is a Perl, JavaScript and Python module author (so far). Ingy is an
 Acmeist. He believes that programming languages act as barriers to hacker
 collaboration, but great hackers push their ideas over the language walls.
