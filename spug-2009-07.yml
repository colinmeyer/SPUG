title: Test::Mimic, extending Test::MockObject
speaker: Brendan Roof

talk_blurb: |
    Brendan has been working on a module tentatively named Test::Mimic. It's
    an extension to the popular Test::MockObject module used to emulate
    troublesome interfaces. Essentially, it allows you to record the behavior
    of a class and then play that behavior back later -- automatically mocking
    class and object methods. Brendan will cover some examples of how to use
    the module and discuss some of the more interesting issues related to its
    design. Feedback is welcome and appreciated!

    Brendan is a senior at the University of Washington majoring in computer
    science and mathematics. He is currently a summer intern at WhitePages
    where he works with Tye McQueen. He's relatively new to Perl, but likes
    what he's seen so far.
