    Josh ben Jore is a crab wranger according to the internet or a serial
    presenter at YAPC::NA or a senior engineer at WhitePages.com. He came to
    Perl because he had to write a CGI appfor a political campaign and he'd
    heard that Perl was best for that sort of thing. Since then, he's been
    slacking off by writing or maintaining several dozen CPAN modules. His
    latest perl-fu has been to shrink the memory usage of some honking big
    in-memory databases and separately, helping get perl-5.12.0 out the door.
