speaker: Tye McQueen & Dave Olszewski

talk_blurb: |
    Git Best Practices and Gotches, and some custom tools to help, especially
    when using Git as a central repository (as is common in a corporate
    environment). Q+A may be a popular part of the talk.

    Tye McQueen is a Sr Perl Dev for WhitePages and absentee landlord of
    PerlMonks.org, proud author of Acme::ESP and several
    less important modules.

    Dave Olszewski is a long time perl geek, newfound git geek.  Since being
    thrust into it, he has seen the light and spent many late nights exploring
    the strange and dusty corners of this life-altering tool.  To quote a
    recent visitor to #git: "who would have f* believed you could get an
    adrenaline rush from a friggin' SCM!"
