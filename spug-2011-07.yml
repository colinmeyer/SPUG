    Introducing two new modules Log::Lager and Data::Abridge.

    Data::Abridge takes complex Perl data structures and strips them down for easy serialization.
    Log::Lager - logging rethought, rehashed and restructured.  It was written to support Log::Lager.

    Log::Lager is built on these principles:
       * logging should be easy to add to code
       * logs should be easy to process programmatically
       * logging should be configurable in a running program
       * logging should be configurable over any subset of a program

    GASP at the amazing design decisions that came from these four principles!
    SCREAM with frustration when you realize how much time you've wasted configuring complicated log objects!
    THRILL with pleasure when you see how easy logging can be.

    Mark Swayne has been programming Perl for a bit over a decade.  He likes it a lot, far more than he likes writing about himself in the third person.  He is known primarily for having memorized more Tom Lehrer lyrics than can possibly be heathy.
